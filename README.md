## About this project

Hi, I'm Seunghyun. This is a personal portfolio project showcasing some of the work I've done. I used the GSAP library to add various animations throughout the site. The portfolio includes several projects I've completed, each with a breif explanation. You will also find a short introduction and some background information about me.
